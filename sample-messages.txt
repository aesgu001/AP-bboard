Hey guys, I just finished Uncharted. Loved every second of it!
Do you have any recommendations for my next game?

Try Call of Duty! There's the single player campaign with an amazing story.
Then there's multiplayer. A lot of people are online playing this game.
If you'd like, we can play together! What's your user ID?

I prefer the Adventure/RPG genre by the way,
but I'm down to playing other games if they sound fun.

I used to be a Lakers fan, but then I saw how the Warriors played over at Chase.
Mmm, can't get another team like them.

Mine, too! It's my home team, and Jimmy Butler is an amazing forward!
I hope to meet him in person one of these days.

I know it's an old game, but have you heard of TES IV: Oblivion?
I've been playing that one since its release.

I know someone who did, actually! He sent me a group photo of him with his friends!
He also has a poster of him in his room, signed!
The lucky bastard.
